# Code Refactor for Horiseon Website

## Description
The objective for this project was to refactor the existing codebase of a website for a hypothetical marketing agency (Horiseon) to meet accessibility standards and improve search engine optimization. This project was also an introduction to implementing user story and acceptance criteria to complete an assigned developer task. The project was done to test understanding of the curriculum covered in the 01-HTML-Git-CSS unit for the MSU Coding Boot Camp.

## Outcomes

The following changes were made to the webpage to meet accessibility standards, improve SEO, and address the provided acceptance criteria while preserving the front-end appearance:

1. Identified any discrepancies in the existing codebase and made changes to ensure adherence to semantic HTML, including the conversion of div tags to more meaningful and specific elements.
2. Evaluated all HTML elements to ensure they follow a logical hierarchy and semantic structure, independent of styling and positioning.
3. Evaluated all linked images for accessibility and made improvements by adding appropriate alt tags.
4. Corrected a header navigation HREF link to restore proper functionality.
5. Consolidated redundant CSS classes in the stylesheet to improve readability.
6. Provided comments in the HTML and CSS to improve readability and understanding.
